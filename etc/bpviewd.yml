# This is the main bpviewd configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the BPView daemon its 
# instructions.
#


#
# This is the main bpviewd config block which controls the basic
# behaviour of bpviewd. The configuration format is YAML.
#
# Make sure to use correct YAML syntax and especially don't use
# tabs instead of spaces!
#
# The structure and shifting has to be:
# bpviewd:
#   local_host: <local host>
#   local_port: <local port>
#   proto: <tcp|udp>
#   sleep: <seconds>
#   read_chars: <number of characters>
#   cache_host: <cache host>
#   cache_port: <cache port>
#   check_interval: <interval in sec>
#

bpviewd:

# cache_host: Cache host bind address
#    ip address to listen for memcache
#

  cache_host: 127.0.0.1
