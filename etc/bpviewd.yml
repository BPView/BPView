#
# This is the main bpviewd configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the BPView daemon its 
# instructions.
#


#
# This is the main bpviewd config block which controls the basic
# behaviour of bpviewd. The configuration format is YAML.
#
# Make sure to use correct YAML syntax and especially don't use
# tabs instead of spaces!
#
# The structure and shifting has to be:
# bpviewd:
#   local_host: <local host>
#   local_port: <local port>
#   proto: <tcp|udp>
#   sleep: <seconds>
#   read_chars: <number of characters>
#

bpviewd:

#
# local_host: Local host bind address
#    Local ip address to listen for API calls
#
  local_host: "0.0.0.0"

#
# local_port: Local host bind port
#    Port number to listen for API calls.
#

  local_port: 7777
  
#
# proto: Protocol to use for API calls
#    valid values are: tcp | udp
#
  
  proto: tcp
  
#
# sleep: Seconds to sleep between runs
#    Number of seconds to wait between "do something" execution 
#    after queue is clear.
#
  
  sleep: 10

#
# read_chars: number of characters to read from daemon
#    Increase this number when dealing with many dashboards and
#    a lot of data (hosts and services).
#
  
  read_chars: 1024
